Q1. What is SEO and explain the importance of SEO ?

Answer:
    SEO, or Search Engine Optimization, is a set of techniques and strategies used
    to improve a website's visibility in search engine results pages (SERPs). The
    primary goal of SEO is to increase the quantity and quality of organic
    (non-paid) traffic to a website by optimizing various aspects of the site to
    align with search engine algorithms. 
    
    There are some importance of SEO,

    1. Increased Visibility: SEO helps websites rank higher in
    search engine results. When your site appears on the first page of search
    results for relevant keywords, it is more likely to be seen by users. Improved
    visibility can lead to increased website traffic. 
    2. Quality Traffic: SEO targets
    specific keywords and phrases that are relevant to your content or business.
    This means that the traffic generated through SEO is more likely to be
    interested in your products, services, or content, leading to higher conversion
    rates. 
    3. Credibility and Trust: Websites that rank well in search engines are
    often seen as more credible and trustworthy by users. Being on the first page of
    search results can instill confidence in your brand and content. 
    4. Cost-Effective Marketing: Compared to paid advertising, SEO is a cost-effective way to attract
    organic traffic. While it requires an initial investment, the long-term benefits
    can be substantial, and the ongoing maintenance costs are generally lower.
    5. Better User Experience: SEO involves optimizing website structure, content, and
    navigation. These improvements often lead to a better overall user experience,
    making it easier for visitors to find what they're looking for and navigate your
    site. 
    6. Competitive Advantage: Many of your competitors are likely investing in
    SEO. By doing the same, you can level the playing field or even gain a
    competitive advantage in search engine rankings.
