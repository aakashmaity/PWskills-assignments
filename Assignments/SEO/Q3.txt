Q3. What are the Benefits of Using meta tags?

Answer: Meta tags provide several benefits when used in the <head> section of an HTML document. 
        Here are some key advantages,
        1.Improved SEO (Search Engine Optimization): Meta tags, particularly the <title> and <meta name="description"> tags, play a crucial role in SEO. They allow you to specify the title and description of your web page, which are often displayed in search engine results. Well-optimized meta tags can lead to higher click-through rates and improved search engine rankings.
        
        2. Enhanced User Experience: Meta tags provide concise and relevant information about your web page's content. This information is often displayed in search engine results and on social media when users share links. A well-crafted title and description can attract users and set clear expectations about the content they will find on your page.
        
        3. Social Media Sharing: Some meta tags, such as Open Graph and Twitter Cards tags, are used by social media platforms to display rich previews when users share links to your content. This can make your shared links more engaging and visually appealing.
        
        4. Accessibility: Meta tags can be used to specify character encoding (<meta charset="UTF-8">) and set the viewport for responsive design (<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">). These tags help ensure that your web page displays correctly on various devices and browsers, improving accessibility.
        
        5. Browser Compatibility: Meta tags can help address compatibility issues with older web browsers. For example, specifying the X-UA-Compatible meta tag can instruct Internet Explorer to use a specific rendering mode, ensuring your page displays correctly.
        
        6. Web Analytics: Some meta tags are used by web analytics tools, such as Google Analytics, to track user interactions and gather data about your website's performance. These tags help you gain insights into user behavior and engagement.
