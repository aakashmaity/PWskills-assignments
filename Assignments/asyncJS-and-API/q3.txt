The same-origin policy is a security measure implemented by web browsers that restricts how a document or script 
loaded from one origin can interact with a resource from another origin. It helps prevent malicious scripts on 
one page from obtaining access to sensitive data on another page through the browserâ€™s Document Object Model (DOM).


When making AJAX requests, the same-origin policy prevents you from making requests to a different domain 
than the one that served the web page.
To work around this policy, you can use:

CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing): The server can include headers that allow for the resource 
to be accessed by a different origin. The Access-Control-Allow-Origin header in the response allows 
for control over which origins are permitted to access the resource.
