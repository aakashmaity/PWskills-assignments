In JavaScript, loops are used to repeatedly execute a block of code until a certain condition is met. They are 
essential for automating repetitive tasks, iterating over data structures, and handling situations where code 
needs to be executed multiple times without duplicating the same code manually.

1. for Loop
    for (initialization; condition; iteration) {
        // code block to be executed
    }

    example:
        for (let i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
            console.log(i);
        }

2. while Loop
    while (condition) {
        // code block to be executed
    }

    example:
        let i = 1;
        while (i <= 5) {
            console.log(i);
            i++;
        }

3. do...while Loop
    do {
        // code block to be executed
    } while (condition);

    example:
        let i = 1;
        do {
            console.log(i);
            i++;
        } while (i <= 5);


4. for...in Loop
    for (variable in object) {
        // code block to be executed
    }

    example: 
        const person = {
            name: 'John',
            age: 30,
            city: 'New York'
        };

        for (let key in person) {
            console.log(key + ': ' + person[key]);
        }


5. for...of Loop
    for (variable of iterable) {
        // code block to be executed
    }

    example:
        const fruits = ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry'];

        for (let fruit of fruits) {
            console.log(fruit);
        }
