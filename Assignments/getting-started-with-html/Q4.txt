Q4. C Write a short note on Tag and element with an example.

Answer: Tags: They're the building blocks of HTML, written in angle brackets (<>). They define the start and end of an element, 
        giving it structure and meaning. Think of them as instructions for the browser.
        Tags are basicaly two types opening and ending.

        Elements: They're the actual content created by tags, like paragraphs, headings, or images. They hold the information 
        displayed on the page. Imagine elements as the assembled bricks forming the structure.

        example:
        <p>this is paragraph</p>
        So, we can say that "p" without content(children) is just tag.
        The combination of Opening tag and Ending tag with content is called Element.
