Q5. What is the DOCTYPE Declaration in HTML?

Answer: The "Document Type Declaration," or <!DOCTYPE >, is a crucial element that appears at the start of an HTML document.
        It helps guarantee that the page is displayed correctly by informing the web browser or HTML parser the version of HTML
        the document is written in. It usually comes at the start of the HTML document and is not surrounded by angle brackets 
        like other HTML tags.
