    Answer:
        Accessibility in the context of web development refers to the practice of
        designing and developing websites and web applications in a way that ensures
        they are usable and navigable by individuals with disabilities. It involves
        creating digital content that is inclusive and can be perceived, understood, and
        interacted with by a wide range of people, regardless of their physical or
        cognitive abilities. Accessibility aims to provide equal access and
        opportunities to all users, regardless of their disabilities, by removing
        barriers and providing alternative ways to access information and functionality.


        Importance of accessible website:
        1. Inclusivity and Equal Access: Accessibility ensures that people with
        disabilities can access and use web content, participate in online activities,
        and engage with digital services just like everyone else. 
        
        2. Search Engine Optimization (SEO):
        Search engines reward websites that provide accessible content by ranking them
        higher in search results. Properly structured and accessible content can improve
        SEO and increase organic traffic to your site.

        3. People with Visual Impairments: Screen readers and
        braille displays can read aloud or display text on the screen, allowing users
        with visual impairments to access content. 
        
        4. People with Hearing Impairments:
        Captions and transcripts for audio and video content ensure that individuals who
        are deaf or hard of hearing can understand multimedia content. 
        
        5. People with Mobility Impairments: Keyboard navigation and other input methods enable users
        who cannot use a mouse to navigate websites effectively. People with Cognitive
        Disabilities: Clear and consistent navigation, simple language, and predictable
        layouts help individuals with cognitive disabilities better understand and use
        web content. 

        6. Elderly Users: Accessibility features can benefit elderly users who
        may have age-related disabilities, such as diminished vision or motor control.
