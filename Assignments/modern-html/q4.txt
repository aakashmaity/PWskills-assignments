Q4. List any 3 ways which helps us in improving the accessibility of html.

Answer: 
        1. Semantic HTML: Use semantic HTML elements to convey the structure and meaning of content. 
        Semantic elements like <header>, <nav>, <main>, <article>, <section>, <aside>, and <footer> provide 
        additional context to assistive technologies and make it easier for users with disabilities to 
        navigate and understand the content. For example, using <button> for interactive elements instead of <div>
        with JavaScript click handlers improves accessibility.

        2. Proper Use of Headings and Landmarks: Organize content with proper heading structure (<h1> to <h6>), 
        ensuring a logical hierarchy. Screen readers use heading levels to create an outline, aiding users in 
        navigating the page. Additionally, landmarks such as <nav>, <main>, and <footer> provide users with shortcuts 
        to essential sections. Ensuring that these landmarks are appropriately used helps improve the overall 
        accessibility of the document.
        
        3. Accessible Forms: Create accessible forms by providing clear and descriptive labels for form controls. 
        Use the <label> element to associate labels with their respective form fields, aiding users with screen 
        readers. Additionally, utilize proper input types and attributes (such as alt for images) to enhance the user experience.
