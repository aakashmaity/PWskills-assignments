    <h2>Discover great typography and iconography</h2>
    <br />
    <p>
      Our font catalog places typography front and center, inviting users to
      explore, sort, and test fonts for use in more than 135 languages. We
      showcase individual type designers and foundries, giving you valuable
      information about the typographers and their process, as well as analytics
      on usage and demographics. Our series of thematic collections helps you
      discover new fonts that have been vetted and organized by our team of
      designers, engineers, and collaborators, and our default sort organizes
      fonts based on popularity, trends, and your geographic location. You can
      also create your own highly customized collections by filtering families,
      weights, and scripts, plus test color themes, and review sample copy.
      Collections can be shared, making it easy to collaborate on projects and
      ensure typography is optimized and streamlined throughout the design and
      engineering process. In 2021, we added icons to our Google Fonts catalog,
      expanding expressive capability for our users. Our first set was the
      Material icons—delightful, beautifully crafted symbols for common
      communication needs. Download them on desktop to use them in your digital
      products for Android, iOS, and web.
