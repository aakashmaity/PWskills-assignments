    background-color: yellow; /* This will be overridden by internal CSS */

What happens when you target the same elements with inline, internal, and external CSS?

Answer: 
The CSS rules are applied based on their specificity and the order in which they are defined.

Inline CSS: Inline CSS has the highest priority and will override both internal and external CSS.
Internal CSS: Internal CSS has a higher priority than external CSS but lower than inline CSS.
External CSS: External CSS has the lowest priority but is useful for maintaining a consistent style across multiple pages.
